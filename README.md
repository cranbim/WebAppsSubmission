My concept for a social media App is to create an asynchronous collaborative joke platform, a kind of social, colaborative game. Friends connect with each other and then can send the opening line of a joke (max 10 words) with a time target. Any of their friends can add a line to the joke and then reset the timer for aomeone else to complete.
If the timer expires with no completion, the joke gets deleted.
At any point, one of the contributors can click the punchline button and the next person has to bring the joke to a close.
If noone completes the joke it will be deleted.
Completed jokes are published for all to see, and anyone on the platform can upvote with a custard pie and comment.
A leader board of best voted jokes is published.
